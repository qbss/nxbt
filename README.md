I think this is now done. Feel free to use it. I'll tweak it here and there, adding features if I can think any up. If you'd like to make any suggestions, please feel free to E-Mail me at my E-Mail address mentioned above.

Tested as working on Linux Mint 18.2 with the Mate desktop environment.

*Quoting Joe Collins from XBT, which still applies mostly here:*
> Requirements:
> 
> XBT should run on any currently supported Linux distribution with BASH. The dedicated USB drive must be formatted to a Linux native file system such as Ext4 to ensure that file permissions will be stored unchanged.
> 
> â€¦And away we go!
